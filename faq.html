              <h2 class="faq-heading">Session Questions</h2>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How long is a typical session?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  Sessions are usually about one hour, but participation is flexible. People can join late, leave early, or take breaks as needed.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do participants need prior experience?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  Not at all! Sessions are beginner-friendly by design. Volunteers teach patiently at a comfortable pace, and observing or socializing is also a valid way to participate.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do participants have to complete a project?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  The goal is engagement and connection, not completing a specific item. Participants can work at their own pace with no requirements or expectations. 
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is the environment like?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  It depends on the setting and group that day. Sessions are intended to be calm and conversational rather than loud or fast-paced, and we adapt as needed.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is there a required group size?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  No. Group size varies by community and by day. We prioritize a comfortable environment over a fixed number.
                </div>
              </details>

              <h2 class="faq-heading">Materials Questions</h2>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do participants get to keep their materials?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  Yes. Participants are welcome to keep their materials so they can continue between sessions if they’d like.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">

                  We use simple, beginner-friendly materials selected for comfort and accessibility. Specific choices can be adjusted based on the setting and participant needs.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What if someone has limited dexterity or vision?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  We do our best to adapt activities to meet people where they are. Participation can range from hands-on crafting to partial assistance to conversation-only.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is this therapy or medical treatment?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  No. Sessions are not clinical therapy or medical treatment. They are a structured, relationship-centered activity that supports engagement and well-being.
                </div>
              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is this appropriate for memory care?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  Often, yes, depending on the community’s guidance and participant comfort. Activities are low-pressure and can be adapted.

              </details>

              <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What if someone can’t finish a project?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  That’s completely fine! Finishing isn’t the goal. We prioritize participation, comfort, and connection.
                </div>
              </details>
