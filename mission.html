        <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <p>
            The Interwoven Project supports the cognitive, social, and 
            emotional well-being of older adults through consistent, 
            relationship-centered engagement. We partner with senior living 
            communities to run beginner-friendly crochet sessions that 
            encourage focus, conversation, and a sense of purpose. 
            Our work prioritizes dignity, patience, and genuine human 
            connection.

            <h2>What problem we’re addressing</h2>
            <p>
                Many older adults experience limited opportunities for 
                meaningful cognitive stimulation and sustained social 
                interaction, particularly in institutional settings. 
                Activities may exist, but they are often passive, 
                inconsistent, or isolating. We address this by providing 
                regular, low-pressure engagement that promotes active 
                participation and shared attention.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Crochet?</h2>
            <p>
                Crochet offers gentle cognitive engagement through repetition 
                and sequencing while allowing participants to work at their 
                own pace. The tactile, rhythmic nature of the activity creates 
                a calm environment that supports conversation, memory sharing, 
                and emotional comfort. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When appropriate, completed items may be donated or gifted, 
                allowing participants to contribute to others and experience a 
                tangible sense of purpose beyond the activity itself. The craft 
                serves as a tool for connection rather than an end goal.

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
            We run recurring crochet sessions with older adults and 
            train student volunteers to teach patiently and adapt to 
            individual needs. Sessions are designed to promote cognitive 
            engagement, social connection, and emotional well-being 
            through hands-on activity and consistent interaction. When 
            appropriate, participants may choose to donate or gift completed 
            items, but participation is never contingent on completion or output.

        <h2>Why chapters matter</h2>
        <p>
          Chapters let the model scale without losing the human part. Each chapter adapts to its university’s
          structure and local partnerships, while following shared standards for safety, consistency, and quality.
